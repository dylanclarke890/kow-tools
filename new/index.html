        This calculator is a standalone tool used for adding up total experience points and total
        action points, which can be done by filling in the appropriate sections. Once the XP
        calculator section has been filled in, you can use the third section to see if you have
        enough experience points to level your officer up to the level you want, depending on the
        rarity and level they're starting from.
